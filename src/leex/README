From a trapexit forum post by Robert Vierding about the usage of leex and 
syntax of *.xrl files: 

The section headers "Definitions.", "Rules." and "Erlang Code." are literal 
strings which must occur at the beginning of a line. Only the rules section 
is necessary. 

You include macros in the pattern by writing {MacroName}. 
Macros can reference macros. 
Macros are expanded "as is" without any implicit adding of parentheses. 

Within the body of a rule you can access the token characters, 
length and line number thorugh the predefined variables TokenChars, 
TokenLen and TokenLine. 

You return {token,Token}, {end_token,Token}, skip_token or 
{error,ErrorString}. 

The interface to the generated scanner is the standard io interface: 

string/1-2 
token/2-3 
tokens/2-3 
format_error/1
